    "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were inspired by how the visual cortex of the human brain functions when it is recognizing objects. Due to the high performance of CNNs for image classification, this approach has gained a lot of attention and this led to great improvements in machine learning and computer vision applications. Neural networks are able to automatically learn the features from raw data that are most useful for a particular task. This is why neural networks are often thought of as feature extraction engine: that is, the intial layer that immediately follow the input nodes are those that are used to extract low-level features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multilayer neural networks, and in particular, deep convolutional neural networks, construct a feature hierarchy by combing low-levek featurs in layer-like fasion to form high-level features. In the context of images, low-level features like edges and blobs are extracted in the early layers, which are combined together to form high-level features that take more familiar shapes, such as buildings, cars or dogs. CNNs contruct feature maps from input images, where each element in the feature map comes from a local patch of pixels in the input images.\n",
    "\n",
    "A local patch of pixels is refered to as the local receptive field. A CNN's performance on image-related tasks is driven by two important concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sparse connectivity - A single element in the feature map is connected to just a small patch of pixels, as opposed to the whole input image. The latter is true of perceptrons.\n",
    "2. Parameter sharing - The same weights are used for different patches of the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the two concepts, the number of weights in the network drastically decrease, and there is also an improvement in the algorithm's ability to capture salient features. It makes intuitive sense that the nearby pixles are more relevant to each other than pixels that are far away from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs are typically composed of several convolutional layers and subsampling/pooling layers that are followed by one or more full connected layers at the end. The fully connected layers are effectively a multilater perceptron, where every input unit $i$ is connected to every output unit $j$ with weight $w_{ij}$. One thing to note about pooling/subsampling layers is that these do not have any learnable parameters - there are no weights or bias units. Both convolutional and fully connected layers have weights and biases to be optimized."

    "## Performing discrete convolutions in one dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "A discrete convolution (or just a convolution) is a fundamental concept of CNNs. As a basic example, we can look at a discrete convolution between two one-dimensional vectors $\\textbf{x}$ and $\\textbf{w}$. This is denoted by the formula: $\\textbf{y} = \\textbf{x} * \\textbf{w}$, where vector $\\textbf{x}$ is the input, or signal, and $\\textbf{w}$ is referred to as the filter, or kernel. A discrete convolution is mathematically defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textbf{y} = \\textbf{x} * \\textbf{w} \\rightarrow \\textbf{y}[i] = \\sum^\\infty_{k = -\\infty} \\textbf{X}[i - k]\\textbf{w}[k]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The brackets [] are used to denote the indexing for vector elements. The index $i$ runs through each element of the output vector $\\textbf{y}$. The positive and negative infinity indexing for $\\textbf{x}$ needs a bit more explanation - a sum that runs through indices in such a range seems odd because, generally speaking, machine learning applications deal with finite feature vectors. As an example, if vector $\\textbf{x}$ has 10 features with indices 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, then the indices $-\\infty$ to -1 and 10 to $\\infty$ are out of bounds for $\\textbf{x}$. So in order to compute the summation shown in the predecing formula, it is assumed that $\\textbf{x}$ and $\\textbf{w}$ are filled with zeros. This results in an output vetor $\\textbf{y}$ that also has an infinite size with lots of zeros as well. Since this isn't useful in practice, $\\textbf{x}$ is padded only with a finite number of zeros. This process is called zero-padding, or just padding. The original vector $\\textbf{x}$, with padding $p$ = 2 zeroes, the vector changes from [3,2,1,7,1,2,5,4] to [0,0,3,2,1,7,1,2,5,4,0,0].\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume the original input $\\textbf{x}$ and $\\textbf{w}$ have n and m elements, respectively, where m <= n. So the padded vector $\\textbf{x}^p$ has the size $n + 2p$, and the practical formula for computing a discrete convolution will change to:\n",

The problem is that $\\textbf{x}$ and $\\textbf{w}$ are indexed in different directions in this summation. For this reason, we flip one of the vectors, could be either one, after adding the padding. Then we can compute their dot product. So if we flip the filter $\\textbf{w}$ to get $\\textbf{w}^r$, then the dot product $\\textbf{x}[i:i+m] \\cdot \\textbf{w}^r$ is computed to get one element $\\textbf{y}[i]$, where $\\textbf{x}[i:i+m]$ is a patch of $\\textbf{x}$ with size $m$. We use $m$ to determine the size of the patches because the length of $\\textbf{w}$ = $m$ = 4, and this is the vector that will be used with $\\textbf{x}$ to determine a dot product. Therefore, the size of $\\textbf{x}$ must be the same as $\\textbf{w}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Same padding is the most commonly used padding mode in CNNs. One advantage of this approach is that is preserves the height and width of the input images or tensors. On major disadvantage of valid padding versus full and same padding is that the volume of the tensors decreases substantially in networks with many layers, which leads to poor performance.\n",

    "Subsampling is generally applied in two forms of pooling operations in CNNs, max-pooling and mean-pooling (or average-pooling). The pooling layer is denoted by $\\textbf{P}_{n_1 \\times n_2}$. The subscript determines the size of the neighborhood, i.e. the number adjacent pixels in each dimension, in which the max or mean operation is performed. This neighborhood is referred to as pooling size.\n",

    "The advantage of pooling is that it introduces local invariance, meaning that small changes in the local neighborhood do not change the result of max-pooling. It helps generate features that are more robust to noise. Pooling also decreases the size of eatures, which leads to better computational efficiency. This may also reduce overfitting.\n",

    "## Regularizing a neural network with dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether we're using a traditional, fully connected neural network or a CNN, determining the size of the network is a challenge. There are many parameters to consider and these must be tuned to achieve good performance. A network's capacity refers to the level of complexity of the function that it can learn. Small networks are likely to under fit, and very large networks can easily overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, it is common to build a network with large capacity so that it does well on the training set, and then, to prevent overfitting, apply one or more regularization schemes to also achieve good generalization performance on new data. A popular regularization choice is L2 regularization. Another regularization technique that has increased in popularity is called dropout. This can be thoguht of as the consensus, or averaging, that occurs through ensembling. In ensemble learning, several models are trained independently. Then during the prediction phase, we use the consensus of all the models. In the context of neural networks, howevever, training several models and determining averages of multiple models would be too computationally expensive. Dropout is an efficient workaround that trains several models at once and then computes the average predictions during the prediction stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout is typically applied to hidden units of higher layers. During the neural network training phase, a fraction of the hidden units is randomly dropped during every iteration with probability $p_{drop}$ (or the keep probability of $p_{keep} = 1 - p_{drop}$. This is a user-defined parameter, and a common choice is $p$ = 0.5. This dropping of input neurons has the effect rescaling the remaing neurons such that they are rescaled to account for the missing/dropped neurons in higher layers. The effect of dropout is that it forces the network to learn a redundant reprsentation of the data. The network cannot rely on the activation of any one set of hidden units since units are randomly turned off during the training phase and is therefore required to come up with a more general and robust understanding of the patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the learned model is used for prediction, we use all of the neurons, i.e. $p_{drop} = 0$ when making predictions. To ensure that the overall activations are on the same scale during the training and predictions phases, the activations of the active neurons need to be scaled appropriately. If we used $p$ = 0.5, then the activation would need to be halved. In practice, it is inconvenient to scale activations when making predictions, libraries like TensorFlow scale the activations during training. So if we used $p$ = 0.5, then the activations would be doubled.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, drop relates to ensemble learning in that dropping different hidden neurons at random during each iteration effectively trains different models on different features, much like a random forst. Once all of the models are trained, we use a model with all hidden units in play, which allows us to use the average activation from all of the hidden units."

    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we compute the mean of each feature using the training data, and then calculate the standard deviation across all features. The reason for calculating the standard deviation this way, rather than dividing each feature by its own individual standard deviation, is that some features/pixels have a constant value of 255 across all images. This indicates no variation across all samples, and therefore, the standard deviation of those features will be zero, and this would cause a division by zero error. To do this, we can use np.std() without specifying an axis."

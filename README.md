Purpose - On the surface, this portfolio showcases my data science work. More importantly, this serves as a historical record of my journey as I aspire to become a professional data scientist. My intention is not just to demonstrate what I can do, but make clear my passion for continuously developing my technical skills and knowledge of theory.

_If you want to..._

 _...evaluate my knowledge of theory_ - take a look at my annotated walkthrough of Sebastian Raschka's [Python Machine Learning, 2nd Edition](https://github.com/Petersontylerd/DataSciencePortfolio/tree/master/AnnotatedTextWalkthroughs/PythonMachineLearning2ndEd).  

 _...view a large-scale project_ - take a look at (_coming soon_)

Otherwise, this README is organized in a way to make it easy to browse my work and areas of exploration.

Thanks for checking out my portfolio.

## Sections

### Annotated text walkthroughs

Thorough dissection of textbooks and accompanying code sets. Emphasis placed on demonstrating mastery of key concepts by re-articulating key points and annotating, and often expanding upon, textbook code sets.

  - [Python Machine Learning, 2nd Edition](https://github.com/Petersontylerd/DataSciencePortfolio/tree/master/AnnotatedTextWalkthroughs/PythonMachineLearning2ndEd) - Walkthrough of Sebastian Raschka's phenomenal textbook. All code examples were re-typed by me and annotated to reinforce my understanding.

  - [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://github.com/Petersontylerd/DataSciencePortfolio/tree/master/AnnotatedTextWalkthroughs/ISL) - Walkthrough of Introduction to Statistical Learning. Emphasis placed on fine-tuning data visualizations in addition to articulation of statistical learning techniques/

### Academics

Compilations of course work completed during Master of Data Science program at Indiana University.

  - [Applied Machine Learning](https://github.com/Petersontylerd/DataSciencePortfolio/tree/master/Academics/AppliedMachineLearning) - Class taken during Summer 2018 session. Directory includes my term project, all required homework assignments, as well as all optional assignments and lab sessions.

### Projects

Large-scale data science projects.

    "1. Implement Naïve Bayes using Jupyter Notebook and Python as well as the sklearn package using any dataset of your choosing, except animals and student-mat.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the UCI dataset repository (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. or any other legitimate data repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a dataset in which you can predict a multi-class classification (e.g. instead of binary 0 or 1, have more than two classes) for your Y variable. Also select a dataset with more than two features. Split this dataset into training/test splits, and implement any cross-validation method of your choice reporting on the accuracy or error of your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Please don’t select a dataset which is too large as the AI/TA may need to download and run it on their own as well. Also, please provide the link to the data or provide the data as an attachment with this assignment.\n",

    "-One .ipynb file pertaining to the Naïve Bayes implementation and results. The code should print out the accuracy/error rate of the cross-validation procedure pertaining to the highest test and training results (averaged over the number of iterations if needed). Also briefly explain the dataset you have used in a few sentences (these can all be markup or print statements in the .ipynb file)\n",

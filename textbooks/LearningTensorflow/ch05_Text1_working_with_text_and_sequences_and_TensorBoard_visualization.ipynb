    "The idea behind RNN models is that each new element in the sequence contributes new information, which updates the current state of the model. The intuition if close to our commplace understanding of how we process sequential information in our day-to-day. Our memory is not cleared upon arriving at new information - rather, our memory is updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental building block often used for modeling sequential patterns via machine learning is the Markov chain model. In a general sense, we can view our data sequences as \"chains\", with each node in the chain dependent in some way on the previous node, in effect carrying forward the history of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "RNN models are also based on this notion of a chain. Types of RNNs vary in how they maintain and update information. RNNs apply some form of loop where an input $x_t$ (perhaps a word in a sequence) is observed at time $t$, and the network updates its \"state vector\" to $h_t$ from the previous vector $h_{t-1}$. Then the subsequent update will be dependent on $h_t$, which in effect retains the history of the sequence up to that point. This can be thought of as one long unrolled chain, where link in the chain involved the same kind of processing step based on the history understood up to that point in the chain.\n",

    "A simplist view of a 28 x 28 MNIST image sample is to think of it as a sequence of rows (or columns). Each image can be viewed as a sequence of length 28, and each element in the sequence is a vector of 28 pixel values. With this construct in mind, the RNN can be thought of as a scanner, moving from the top of the image to the bottom (when looking at row sequences) or left to right (when looking at column sequences)."
